Turbo City's *Leo Engine*.

This engine was originally created for a remake of `Minecart Madness <https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876750/MinecartMadness/>`_ (which ultimately led to nothing) but has since been repurposed for a number of in-development projects.

There is documentation being created at `Read the Docs <https://leoengine.readthedocs.io>`_.

Unfortunately, because myself and others are currently using the engine in various projects, outside contributions cannot be accepted except in the case of minor bugfixes.
